Hi, I'm Conrad. I'm a machine learning scientist focused on earth science and geospatial problems. 

Recently I've focused on prospectivity mapping using deep learning to discover the critical mineral resources needed for building clean technologies. I also developed proof-of-concept models and performed technology evaluation for adjacent industrial problems. 

My past work includes constraining predictions of sea level rise from ice sheets through uncertainty quantification of numerical ice flow models, and physical modelling of ice-hydrological feedbacks impacting near term sea level rise.

My interests extend to business, startups, and software engineering. Previously I consulted independently, working on projects such helping a medical school use Bayesian models to forecast the progression of residents, or helping a Fortune 500 company track personally identifiable information through its business processes to comply with relevant privacy regulation. I cofounded a startup developing a joint graphical and voice powered user interface completely in-browser for speed and privacy.

Outside of professional life, I enjoy taking advantage of all that British Columbia has to offer. You'll often find me backcountry skiing in the winter, and rock climbing in the summer.
